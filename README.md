# MCP Image Generation

**Status: Incomplete Project**

This was an experimental MCP server for AI image generation that was started but not completed. The project attempted to integrate multiple image generation backends (DALL-E 3, Stability AI, Automatic1111) but proved to be unnecessarily complex for practical use.

## What Was Attempted

- Multi-backend support for image generation
- Cost optimization and backend selection
- Integration with local Automatic1111 instances
- Cloud service API integration

## Why This Project Was Discontinued

This tool was determined to be a "toy" implementation that doesn't provide sufficient value over existing image generation solutions. The complexity of maintaining multiple backends and the limited practical utility led to the decision to discontinue development.

## Alternatives

For image generation needs, consider:
- Direct use of DALL-E 3 via OpenAI API
- Stability AI's official tools
- Local Automatic1111 web interface
- Other mature image generation platforms

## Project Status

**Archived** - No further development planned.

This repository is maintained as a reference of what was attempted, but the server has been removed from active MCP configurations.
